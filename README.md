# 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

## What do LIFO and FIFO mean?

The primary difference between Stack and Queue Data Structures is that Stack follows LIFO while Queue follows FIFO data structure type. LIFO refers to Last In First Out. It means that when we put data in a Stack, it processes the last entry first. Conversely, FIFO refers to First In First Out. It means that when we put data in Queue, it processes the first entry first. Let us understand further the differences between them.
